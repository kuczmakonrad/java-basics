/*
Can we call run() method directly to start a new thread
No, you can not directly call run method to start a thread.
You need to call start method to create a new thread.
If you call run method directly , it wonâ€™t create a new thread and it will be in same stack as main.

Lets understand with the help of example:

When using:
    run() - As you can see when we are directly calling run method, it is not creating new threads.
    start() - working well.

You can not directly call run method to create a thread, you need to call start method to create a new thread.

                e.printStackTrace();
            }

            System.out.println("Thread is running: " + i);
