Stack is abstract data type which depicts Last in first out (LIFO) behavior.
Although java provides implementation for all abstract data types such as Stack,Queue and LinkedList,
but it is always good idea to understand basic data structures and implement them yourself.
Please note that Array implementation of Stack is not dynamic in nature. You can implement Stack through linked list for dynamic behavior.

Stack supports following basic operations:
    * push: Push element to the top of the Stack. This operation will increase size of stack by 1.
    * pop: Remove element from the top of the Stack and returns the deleleted Object. This operation will decrease size of stack by 1.
    * isEmpty: Check if Stack is empty or not.
    * isFull: Check if Stack is full or not.
    * peek: Returns top element from the stack without removing it.

We can implement it for 3 ways:
    * Using Array ->       pl.kuczdev.__code_questions.q41_stack_implement_using_array.StackImplementUsingArray
    * Using LinkedList ->  pl.kuczdev.__code_questions.q42_stack_implement_using_linked_list.StackImplementUsingLinkedList
    * Using Two Queues ->  pl.kuczdev.__code_questions.q43_stack_implement_using_two_queries.StackImplementUsingTwoQueries

Also we can looks on topic:
    * how to sort stack using another stack -> pl.kuczdev.__code_questions.q44_stack_sorting_by_another_stack.StackSortingByAnotherStack is abstract data type which demonstrates Last in first out (LIFO) behavior. We will implement same behavior using Array.
